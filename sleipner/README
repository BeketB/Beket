NOTE 1:
The grid file is larger than github's file size limit, and has been
compressed with gzip. To decompress it, do:

  gunzip Sleipner_Reference_Model_cleaned.grdecl.gz

on the command line (in Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux).

NOTE 2:
The data for feeder and intralayer permeabilities are not the mean
values given in the original dataset, but are updated by history
matching with ERT and OPM Flow. This part is therefore considered
Adapted Material under the license.
