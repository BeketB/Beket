opm-data
========

This is the OPM repository which is supposed to contain all relevant
datasets and simulation results which are required to test the OPM
simulators thoroughly.


Unless stated otherwise, decks are now provided under the open
database license available in the file odbl-10.txt, and new decks
should also be provided under the same or a compatible license.
Similarly, data contained in or pointed to by the decks is licensed
under the open database content license available in the file
dbcl-10.txt.

Note that the git history contains proprietary decks (now removed) where
usage restrictions may apply.
